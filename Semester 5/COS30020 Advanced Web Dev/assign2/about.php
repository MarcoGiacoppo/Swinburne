            <div class="label">Tasks not attempted or completed:</div>
            <div class="value">None. All core tasks have been completed as per the requirements. Auto-population of the friends and myfriends tables, dynamic navbar, styling, and dynamic content based on login status are implemented.</div>

            <div class="label">Special features added:</div>
            <div class="value">Implemented dynamic navigation that changes based on login status, a table-like layout for displaying data, and auto-population of the database with sample data. Additionally, I styled the layout to look modern and user-friendly using CSS Grid and Flexbox.</div>

            <div class="label">Parts I had trouble with:</div>
            <div class="value">Initially, there was some difficulty with the auto-population of the database, especially when tables already existed. However, this was resolved by ensuring that population only happens when the tables are empty.</div>

            <div class="label">What I would like to do better next time:</div>
            <div class="value">Next time, I would focus on enhancing the user interface design from the beginning to ensure a more polished layout. Additionally, implementing more advanced features like search functionality or real-time updates would be a priority.</div>

            <div class="label">Additional features added:</div>
            <div class="value">A dynamic header that changes based on the login status, more extensive styling to make the site visually appealing, and added a system to auto-populate the database with sample users and friendships to facilitate easier testing.</div>
